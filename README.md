# XKCD-Bot
A Discord bot that randomly references XKCD comic strips.

If you want to use it yourself, make sure to edit Secrets.toml and substitute your own bot token - ensure that you also have the correct permissions (admin permissions are recommended and message content intent is necessary).


While the project is under the MIT license, that only constitutes the original work shown in rust and python: the code. The images in this repository are under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 Generic (CC BY-NC 2.5) license, with the original owner being Randall Munroe. Essentially, feel free to do whatever with the code (I take no responsibility), but don't be selling the XKCD comic images or using them without attribution.
Speaking of attribution, I of course credit XKCD.com and Randall Munroe for the creation of the comics - thanks for making them!
